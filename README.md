# NN Learn from random value
This notebook is about seeing how neural network learn with only 1 input learns to fit a graph to some random datas. At first I tried to use a lot of datas, but even with a lot of epochs the loss is still very high.
So I tried using only 5 random datas and make them as simple as possible. And it works! The model can fit the graph to the datas.
